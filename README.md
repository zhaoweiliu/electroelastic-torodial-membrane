# torodial-membrane-electroelastic
This MatLab program is to solve the deformation of a coupled electro-elastic toroidal membrane.

Please run script "main_scaled.m" to simulate the problem. The solution is highly dependent on the initial guesses and some sample initial guesses are provided in the initialness.txt.
